Building
--------

Setup a proper Android development environment.

Get a copy of YouTubeAndroidAPI-0.3.6, and put it in third-party.

Do whatever sort of IntelliJ / Android magic is necessary to properly link it in:

	- See: http://soledadpenades.com/2011/06/17/android-library-projects-with-intellij-idea/

	- This should create a
	  third-party/YouTubeAndroidAPI-0.3.6/library/library.iml file.

	- project.properties should contain:
	  android.library.reference.1=third-party/YouTubeAndroidAPI-0.3.6/library
	  or something like that.
